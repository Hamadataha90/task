             <summary>Find a Missing Package That Shows as Delivered</summary>
             <p>If tracking shows as delivered in Your Orders but you cannot locate your item(s); Try your safe place location, check with neighbors if safe to do so or contact the carrier (some carriers deliver until 10pm).</p>

            </details><br><br>
           <details> <summary>Carrier Contact Information</summary>
            <p>We work with the following carriers to deliver items. If you have an issue with your delivery, you can contact the carrier directly.
             <address>Important: </address>Some national carriers use regional carriers to deliver your package. When this happens, your tracking information may not be accurately reflected on the national carrier website.
             We ship some exceptionally large or heavy items by a specialty carrier such as CEVA, Pilot, or XPO. We use Parcel Pool for standard deliveries to Alaska and Hawaii, and OnTrac for same-day deliveries to Seattle.
             
             Delivery Instructions entered on your Amazon account are only visible to Amazon Drivers. If your package is being delivered by a different carrier, please contact them to provide those instructions.

                <summary>Missing Tracking Information</summary>
                <p><address>Here are some reasons why tracking information may not be available:</address>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first package scan may be on arrival at a regional hub near the destination. This is common when shipping volume is high and packages are processed in bulk. Until this first scan, the carrier may not acknowledge receipt of the package.</li>
                    <li>The first package scan may not be until delivery.</li>
                    <li>There may be a delay in updates to the tracking database.</li>
                    <li>Some shipments, such as Standard International shipments, aren't trackable.</li>
                    <li>Marketplace sellers don't always provide us with tracking information for their orders.</li>
                    <li>f the tracking number starts with "TBA", see About Deliveries Shipped with Amazon.</li>
                    <li>The order is a gift and the giver selected the option for the recipient to provide their shipping address during the checkout process.</li>

                    </ul>
